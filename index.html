            Even though we're miles apart, it never feels like it because our bond is unbreakable. I’m so grateful for every moment we've shared, and even more excited for all the future memories we’ll create, no matter where we are. You’ve been my constant source of laughter, support, and love, and I truly treasure every conversation and moment we’ve had, even if it’s over a screen.
            
            I hope your day is as amazing as you are and that this year brings you everything you've been hoping for. I can't wait until we’re together again, but until then, know that I’m thinking of you and sending you all the love across the miles. 🌍❤️
            
            Here's to many more adventures, laughs, and all the good things we still have to experience together. I love you more than words can say! 🥰</p>
